# library
Library Project from TOP


I have stopped working on this as of July 23.  I was able to build a library where you can add/remove a book, mark it as read, etc.  Also, books that are added are saved in local storage so you are able to refresh/close the page and still have a book.  If I come back to this, there are a few things to improve:

- Make the overall formatting look better, including the modal
- Add an edit button to be able to edit a book.
- Add a button to clear local storage
