Library Project from TOP


I think that I am finished for now (July 22, 2021).  I'm now able to create a book, remove a book, etc.  I may play around with using local storage, but so far things are OK. 

Notes:
- I need to figure out how to create a popup modal when I click on "add book"  (done)
- I need to figure out how to use javascript with forms (done)
- I need to create a complete example of what a finished book should look like (sliders, delete, etc) (good enough)
- I will need to create a function to create books by divs (I can create books on the shelf, no problem)
- Need to connect the toggle so that it updates whether or not a book is read or not (done)
- Need to be able to delete a book from the shelf by clicking the 'x' icon (done)
- Need to update the formatting of the modal






CAPTURE:
- Need to be show 'pages' text in pages section
- Need to confirm that you can't add the same book more than once.
- Need to color the skeleton
- Need to style the new text
- Add a pencil edit icon and allow users to edit the book after creation
- make the book boxes square
